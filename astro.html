In this story, a robot called Speedy keeps running around a pool of selenium in circles after being ordered to extract some by Mike Donovan. The line of robots that Speedy belongs to are built to especially obey Rule 3 since they are very expensive. Knowing this, and the fact that the order was given casually, can you predict why Speedy was running around in circles?"

Some physicists have suggested that they could be made using magnetic fields to control plasma, which is a gas that has been stripped off all of its electrons, leaving it completely ionised. This is done by superheating the gas.Assuming that there are energy sources that can create plasma and are small enough to be housed in the holster of the lightsabre, what are the problems with the above scenario?"
